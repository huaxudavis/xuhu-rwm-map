#This python script split the mis-assembled SNP chunks  

== Summary ==

This script will split the mis-assembled scaffolds at SNP-groups that show a high number of differences to their neighboring SNP-groups.  The edge SNP-group is removed.  The new scaffolds will get a new unique name.  As the cutoff-number one can choose the number of allowed differences between the haplotypes of adjacent SNP groups(for example: 25 ### for 88 samples)
