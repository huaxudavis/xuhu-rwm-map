#Script to summarize the genotype data for groups of SNPs.

== Summary ==

This python script summarize the genotype data for groups of SNPs along the reference sequence â€“ for example sum the occurrence of 'A', 'B','-','U' for groups of 20 consecutive SNPs.  

== Details ==

=== Parameters ===
  * Input file
  * number of scaffolds per group to sum
    * if opt is l: it is the number of lines for each scaffold to sum, if num set to 0, scaffold will sum by ID name;
    * if opt is b, it is the position range to sum.
  * opt: l - sum by lines or b - sum by position range
  * format: f - first run or s - second run(has two extra blank lines between groups and two extra cols); s option does not work with b option

=== Sample Command ===
{{{
$ python 03-SumByGroup.py genotypes-test2.tsv 1000000 b f

=== Input and Output ===

  * Input file: -- genotype file: [http://xuhu-rwm-map.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/data/genotypes-test2.tsv genotypes-test2.tsv]

  * Output file: -- parsed file with start position, end position, SNP counts, and genotype data: [http://xuhu-rwm-map.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/data/sum_genotypes-test2.tsv sum_genotypes-test2.tsv]
